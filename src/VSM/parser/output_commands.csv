          This command may trigger a mission state-machine change on some systems: for example from MISSION_STATE_NOT_STARTED or MISSION_STATE_PAUSED to MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE.
          If the system is in mission mode, on those systems this command might therefore start, restart or resume the mission.
          If the system is not in mission mode this command must not trigger a switch to mission mode.

          The mission may be ""reset"" using param2.
          Resetting sets jump counters to initial values (to reset counters without changing the current mission item set the param1 to `-1`).
          Resetting also explicitly changes a mission state of MISSION_STATE_COMPLETE to MISSION_STATE_PAUSED or MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE, potentially allowing it to resume when it is (next) in a mission mode.
